## Part 01, Section 4 of the Udemy course


Until now I haven't really felt the need to practice after continuing with the Udemy course.
That means I also had problems with memorizing what I've just watched
So I started practicing and fiddling with the resources, altering them a bit and try to think of a way I would use them.

### Note: Things are commented out because I was practicing these 3 topics in a single solution.

<br>

### This part contains:
  * Constructor & Destructor
  * Getter & Setter
  * String Stream

<br>

### Learn programming:
If you are interested in learning C++, I can wholeheartedly recommend tagging along with this course:<br>

I've had alot of troubles with understanding the basics, and having a good,
easy to understand reference / tutorial that I can always go back to.

This course to me felt like the missing piece I needed,
so I am very grateful I have a friend who recommended it to me. (<3)
